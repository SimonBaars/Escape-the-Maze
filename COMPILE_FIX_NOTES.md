# Compilation Issues - Fixed

## Problem
The project was failing to compile with multiple errors in the Android module:
- `cannot find symbol: class PApplet`
- `cannot find symbol: class Node`
- `cannot find symbol: class PImage`
- `cannot find symbol: class APMediaPlayer`
- `cannot find symbol: class Pathfinder`

## Root Cause
The file `android/src/processing/test/escapethemazeandroid/EscapeTheMazeAndroid.java` contained legacy Processing code that was left behind after the LibGDX migration. This file:
1. Extended `PApplet` (Processing's main application class)
2. Used Processing-specific classes like `PImage`, `APMediaPlayer`, etc.
3. Imported packages that weren't included as dependencies (`processing.core.*`, `apwidgets.*`, `ai.pathfinder.*`)

## Solution
Removed the legacy Processing code and dependencies:
1. Deleted `android/src/processing/test/escapethemazeandroid/EscapeTheMazeAndroid.java`
2. Deleted `android/libs/ai_path.jar`
3. Deleted `android/libs/apwidgets.jar`
4. Deleted `android/libs/processing-core.jar`

## Why This Is Correct
The project has been properly migrated to LibGDX:
- The actual Android launcher is `android/src/com/escapethemaze/android/AndroidLauncher.java` (LibGDX-based)
- The `AndroidManifest.xml` references the LibGDX launcher, not the Processing file
- All game logic has been reimplemented in the `core` module using LibGDX
- The Processing `.pde` files in the root directory are preserved for reference but not compiled

## Result
The Android module now only contains the proper LibGDX launcher that references the game implementation in the core module. All compilation errors related to missing Processing classes have been resolved.
