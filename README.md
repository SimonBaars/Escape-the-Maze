# Escape the Maze
Maze Runner inspired Android Game by Simon Baars

Escape the Maze is a running game where you are dropped in a grass field in the middle of a huge maze. But not only that: you're alone! Figure out how the maze works and try to escape. But watch out... Monsters are out there! And no-one has ever survived a night in the maze...
In this app you actually have to discover the secrets of this game. Escape the Maze has a lot of important features, which make the game as realistic as possible:
- A day/night cycle: keep track of where you go in the maze as a night in the maze is hard to survive...
- The struggle to to gather food: you gotta make all the food on your own, one wrong decision and you might starve...
- A complex maze: can you find the exit?
- A lot of items to help you unravel the mysteries of the maze

Also, I made this app completely free! No in-app payments, no ads, no tracking stuff, nothing!

Currently known bugs/issues:
- Pigs can get trapped in wood blocks
- You tell me!

(Probably) upcoming features:
- More Items (Ideas are welcome at admin@diy-games.com)
- More ways to actually escape the maze and defeat the bugs
- Performance improvements (I think I should be able to double the fps)
- Faster saving and loading
- An overall smoother game experience
